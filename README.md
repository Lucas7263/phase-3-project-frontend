## Usage

## The spa list
In this application, you will be able to see a list of favorite dog spas and information regarding each one.

You will also be able to view the current guests of each of these spas using a dropdown box.

## Adding a spa
Using the navigation bar at the top of the page you can click on Add Spa and be brought to a page with a form that
you can fill out to add a new spa to the spa list.

## Checking in a dog
In the navigation bar at the top of the page, there is a "Check-in" link that will bring you to another form that you can fill out to add a new dog to the application.

In this form, there is a dropdown box that you use to select which spa you would like your dog to be checked into.

After clicking the check-in button you will be brought to the spa list page where you can see your dog as a new guest of the spa you selected.

## All dogs
Following this link will bring you to a list of all the dogs currently staying at all of the spas.

Here you can see all the info about each dog as well as two buttons for each one.

The first button is an update button where you may edit the information for your dog to correct any mistakes made when first checking it into a spa.

The second button is a check-out button which will remove your selected dog from its current spa and be removed entirely from the application.
